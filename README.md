# Inventory Management System

This is a simple web-based inventory management system that allows you to add, display, and order items. It uses JavaScript and HTML to create an interactive interface where you can manage a list of inventory items.

## Features

- Add new items to the inventory with a name, price, stock quantity, and an image.
- Display the inventory items as cards, showing their image, name, price, stock quantity, description, and an order selector.
- Order items by incrementing or decrementing the order count.
- View a summary of ordered items with quantities and names.
- Validation for empty order submissions.

## Getting Started

3. You can add new items to the inventory by filling out the form and clicking the "Add Item" button. The added items will be displayed as cards.

4. To order items, click the "Order" button. If you have items in your order, a message will appear with a summary of your ordered items.

5. You can increment or decrement the order count of each item using the ➡️ and ⬅️ buttons in the item cards.
